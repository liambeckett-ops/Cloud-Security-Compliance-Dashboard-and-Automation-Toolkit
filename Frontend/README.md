# Cloud Security Compliance Dashboard - Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend for the Cloud Security Compliance Dashboard and Automation Toolkit. It displays compliance check results fetched from the backend API.

## Setup
1. Make sure the backend API is running (see backend README for details).
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. The dashboard will automatically fetch and display compliance results.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main dashboard page.
- `app.js`: JavaScript to fetch and display compliance data.

## Customization
You can style the dashboard by editing the CSS in `index.html` or add new features in `app.js`.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the backend is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000/compliance`.
- Check browser console for errors if data does not appear.
